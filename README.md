# What is the most difficult part about this week's challenge?

There was nothing terribly difficult. It just takes a lot of time to figure out what you're doing, especially when working with tools that are new to you. I very much enjoyed the API part of this, but not so much the Refine challenges. Pictures also take so long to include in the readme as well.

## How do you relate to this article personally? (3 points)

It talks about how into the 21st century many Millennials are, and whether or not that is harmful for society. I may be biased, but I can't stand skeptics who think that technology and a data-driven lifestyle is ruining how we interact with the world. I love the idea of technology being more and more a part of our lives.
