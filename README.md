# What is the most difficult part about this week's challenge?

I would have to say that the last two challenges of Refine took me a bit and just getting Node and the js files up and running gave me a little trouble.

## How do you relate to this article personally? (3 points)

I have two dogs at home and always have a curiousity as to how long they sleep a day, where they go, and what they do all day when I am gone. I have a cat in my apartment who sleeps even longer than a dog so I'm sure tracking her sleep patterns and where she goes outside would be very interesting to discover.
