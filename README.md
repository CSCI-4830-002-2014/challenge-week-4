[The Quantified Self: How Data-Obsessed Trackers Push Toward Healthier Lives](http://www.livescience.com/44618-quantified-self-culture.html)

## How do you relate to this article personally? (3 points)

Although I do not fully relate with the activity of tracking my every move,
I understand the usefulness of doing so. There are countless habits, thoughts, etc.
that lend itself to improvement via the scientific method. For example, I often assess my thought
processes and associated emotions. There is a clear relation between the two. I can
see how useful it might be to track EVERYTHING of that variety as means of self-improvement.

On the other hand, I wonder if examining oneself under the microscope of data could be
considered obsessive, and possibly be used as means of self-degradation. Sometimes I think
you just have to enjoy life as it comes, and not constantly imagine various trivial ways to
'optimize' yourself. Just be, per se.

To dust off an old cliche, everything in life is a balance.
