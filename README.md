# What is the most difficult part about this week's challenge?

The most dificult part was getting restler functioning. There were no introductory or beginner tutorials for what we are doing, so getting the first challenge was very difficult. Props to @peymanmortazavi for the assistance in getting the ball rolling with restler.

## How do you relate to this article personally? (3 points)

I am very interested in nutrition, so seeing this chart of weigth loss was very interesting. 
Especially that this reddit user could point out specific meals on his weight chart. 
Who knew that having the extra portion of pizza and corned beef could show a visible spike for your weight loss!?
