[Forget the Quantified Self, We need to Build the Quantified Us](http://www.wired.com/2014/04/forget-the-quantified-self-we-need-to-build-the-quantified-us/)

## How do you relate to this article personally? (3 points)

The implications in the article are natural and interseting: we get more useful data about ourselves if we are able to compare our gathered data with others. The article argues for a "Quantified Us", but ignores the security and privacy implications that suggests. I worked for Center for Democracy and Technology this summer and one of the largest projects they work on is preserving privacy in a digital age. I learned two things from that experience; most users don't care and it is -hard- from a developers point of view to ensure all the data you collect is private. As we move toward a quantified self/us I hope we are able to keep privacy implications in mind.
