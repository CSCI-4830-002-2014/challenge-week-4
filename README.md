# What is the most difficult part about this week's challenge?

I initially had a little trouble with the OpenRefine challenges - I had a to redo things a few times, so some of the screenshots may be inconsistent as far as chronological order. I'm not 100% comfortable working with it yet and need a little more practice.

## How do you relate to this article personally? (3 points)

The movement toward wearable health technologies is growing rapidly, as the idea of 'life-logging' is very appealing to those interested in bettering their own health and lives. I don't yet have any such devices of my own, though I'm interested in trying some out.
