## How do you relate to this article personally? (3 points)

It is encouraging to see how beneficial data, when tracked and analyzed, can help to improve the lives of everyday people. I thought it was really cool how a Swedish engineer was able to figure out the best drug combination to combat her Parkinson's disease. I have looked at apps that help you track your calorie intake with the amount of exercise you get, as I am particularly interested in tracking my health to become more physically fit. I've also been hearing a lot of doctors talking more and more about preventative care and how that would greatly decrease healthcare costs; self-quantification is an incredible tool that lets us be active in staying healthy and improving our lives.
